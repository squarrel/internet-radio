This is a basic internet radio app for Android. It uses the android service, via Kivy. Play the radio station, close the app and the radio will keep playing as a service in the background. 
Currently when the screen shuts down, the radio stops, too. That's something to further work upon, as it needs the utilization of android's WAKE_LOCK. All in all, it works, but has some small bugs and lays there unfinished in my hard drive, so I thought of sharing the code. It's worth taking a look, it shows how to communicate with the service using Kivy.
